# Chartjs Samples By Chong

## Installation
- Chart.js can be installed via npm or bower. It is recommended to get Chart.js this way. 

### npm
- `npm install chart.js --save`

### Bower
- `bower install chart.js --save`

## Selecting the Correct Build
- Chart.js provides two different builds for you to choose: Stand-Alone Build, Bundled Build.

### Stand-Alone Build
Files:
- `dist/Chart.js`
- `dist/Chart.min.js`

The stand-alone build includes Chart.js as well as the color parsing library. If this version is used, you are required to include Moment.js before Chart.js for the functionality of the time axis.
